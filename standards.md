## Common Workflow Language (CWL)

[Common Workflow Language (CWL)](http://www.commonwl.org/) is a standard for defining a workflow independent of the system used to create or run it.

>The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an informal, multi-vendor working group consisting of various organizations and individuals that have an interest in portability of data analysis workflows. Our goal is to create specifications that enable data scientists to describe analysis tools and workflows that are powerful, easy to use, portable, and support reproducibility.
>
>CWL builds on technologies such as JSON-LD and Avro for data modeling and Docker for portable runtime environments.
>
>CWL is designed to express workflows for data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy.
